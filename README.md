## Katya-yani Vyas

I am a junior software developer looking to start a career in the industry and hoping to make a difference. I have been working in communications, policy and project management for the last three years, giving me a wide range of skills, but also an appreciation for the way that software and, more broadly, engineering underpin practically every industry.

Having taken an interest in software development at university, I decided to revisit it and apply to Makers Academy where I learnt not just to code, but that I love to code and create clean, test-driven software. I promise to adapt, learn quickly and try to be one of the most efficient and effective people you have ever hired.

### Professional Skills

* #####Full Stack Web Development
  I initially started coding at university with C++ and Matlab, I moved on to HTML and CSS in order to design and code newsletters and simple websites for various jobs. Having completed a 12 week intensive training course in software development at Makers Academy, I went from knowing only the basics to being able to build fully tested web applications.

* #####Problem Solving
  I naturally enjoy solving problems and studying Physics at university allowed me to refine and practice this. At Makers Academy, problem solving is a way of life, and there is an emphasis on thinking logically. I have learnt a great deal about the process of problem solving in programming, and I have enjoyed coming up with solutions to real world and also fun mathematical problems, such as the following:

  ```
  def fibonacci(number)
    number <= 1 ? number :  fibonacci( number - 1 ) + fibonacci( number - 2 )
  end
  ```

* #####Project Management
  I have extensive experience managing teams of people to deliver projects to tight deadlines. While working at the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering (QEPrize), I created and managed a number of events and helped to design the international media strategy of the award. In addition to this, I was responsible for the entire digital profile of the QEPrize, from social media strategy to helping design and launch the website. I also moved many of the databases online and ensured that the present team were able to continue sending newsletters and maintain the website.

### Work History

##### Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering (QEPrize)
###### *Communications Manager: August 2013 - June 2015*
*Developed and managed the QEPrize communications strategy, including the relaunch of the website, social media expansion and the creation of an international media plan.
*Oversaw the media strategy for all key milestones, including the announcement of the second winner, Dr Robert Langer, in February 2015. This event attracted global coverage with a media reach of 600 million people.
*Helped create a network of Engineering Ambassadors to inspire the next generation, particularly girls, to become engineers.
*Managed a national competition for youung people to design the trophy presented by HM The Queen to the winners of the QEPrize.
*Created and maintained the digital profile of the award.
*Planned and delivered a number of events, including a party at the TATE Modern to celebrate the wonders of modern engineering, the announcement of the QEPrize winner and a number of events designed to inspire young people to pursue a career in engineering.
*Managed a communications budget to maximise the international profile of the QEPrize.

###### *Manager: April 2012 - July 2013*
*As part of the team that launched the QEPrize, this job involved a number of different tasks including: High-level stakeholder management, design work, writing and social media.
*Helped to plan and deliver the announcement of the very first QEPrize winner, the creators of the Internet and the world wide web: Sir Tim Berners Lee, Vint Cerf, Robert Langer, Marc Andreessen and Louis Pouzin.
*Worked with a team to organise the inaugural QEPrize Awards Ceremony at Buckingham Palace, where the winners were presented with a trophy by HM The Queen. The QEPrize trophy was designed by an aspiring engineering student who won a national competition and who was given the opportunity to work with artist, Thomas Heatherwick.
*We operated in a similar way to a start-up, under intense time pressure and with incredibly tight deadlines.

Working at the QEPrize was an incredible and humbling experience. In addition to collaborating with and meeting some of the worldâ€™s most distinguished engineers (and HM The Queen), I was privileged to work with and for a remarkable group of people.
