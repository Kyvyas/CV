## Katya-yani Vyas

I am a junior software developer looking to start a career in the industry and hoping to make a difference. I have been working in communications, policy and project management for the last three years, giving me a wide range of skills, but also an appreciation for the way that software and, more broadly, engineering underpin practically every industry.

Having taken an interest in software development at university, I decided to revisit it and apply to Makers Academy where I learnt not just to code, but that I love to code and create clean, test-driven software. I promise to adapt, learn quickly and try to be one of the most efficient and effective people you have ever hired.

* Full Stack Web Devlopment
  Having completed a 12 week intensive training course in software development at Makers Academy, I went from knowing only the basics to being able to build fully tested web applications.
* Problem Solving
  I naturally enjoy solving problems and studying Physics at university allowed me to refine and practice my problem solving skills.
