## Katya-yani Vyas

I am a junior software developer looking to start a career in the industry and hoping to make a difference. I have been working in communications, policy and project management for the last three years, giving me a wide range of skills, but also an appreciation for the way that software and, more broadly, engineering underpin practically every industry.

Having taken an interest in software development at university, I decided to revisit it and apply to Makers Academy where I learnt not just to code, but that I love to code and create clean, test-driven software. I promise to adapt, learn quickly and try to be one of the most efficient and effective people you have ever hired.

### Professional Skills

* #####Full Stack Web Development
  I initially started coding at university with C++ and Matlab, I moved on to HTML and CSS in order to design and code newsletters and simple websites for various jobs. Having completed a 12 week intensive training course in software development at Makers Academy, I went from knowing only the basics to being able to build fully tested web applications.

* #####Problem Solving
  I naturally enjoy solving problems and studying Physics at university allowed me to refine and practice this. At Makers Academy, problem solving is a way of life, and there is an emphasis on thinking logically. I have learnt a great deal about the process of problem solving in programming, and I have enjoyed coming up with solutions to real world and also fun mathematical problems, such as the following:

  ```
  def fibonacci(number)
    number <= 1 ? number :  fibonacci( number - 1 ) + fibonacci( number - 2 )
  end
  ```

* #####Project Management
  I have extensive experience managing teams of people to deliver projects to tight deadlines. While working at the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering (QEPrize), I created and managed a number of events and helped to design the international media strategy of the award. In addition to this, I was responsible for the entire digital profile of the QEPrize, from social media strategy to helping design and launch the website. I also moved many of the databases online and ensured that the present team were able to continue sending newsletters and maintain the website.
